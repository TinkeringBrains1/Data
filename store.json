The laser slides application can be best viewed in Tablet devices with a minimum screen size of 8” inches.\nInstructions:\n-- Firstly, in order to use the laser slides application the system should have BEYOND software installed in the system.\n-- On the BEYOND application we must go to the “setting” -> “OSC” -> “OSC settings” and then look up for the IP address such as “192.168.29.219”.\n-- Once we know the IP address, start the laser slides application on a tablet device. We should configure the settings to control the slides in BEYOND software.\n-- Now go to settings in the application enter the IP address and PORT as “8000”, After entering the values in the fields click on the “Save” button, if you see a popup with message “Connection Successful” you are good to go!!.\n-- Now that we have made a successful connection with BEYOND, Go to the “Home” section in the app. Here you can control the slides with various buttons and customize with your desired functionality as well.\n-- The Slides are generally manipulated using OSC commands, which you can assign to each button on “double tapping” on any button.\n-- You can see a popup on your screen by double tapping on any button. The popup has various fields, Here enter the desired button name, and the OSC command such as “0 1” or “0 3” etc. once entered click on save button and the settings will be saved.\n-- The initial digit in the OSC command represents the row number and the second number represents the cell number in that row.\nAll the OSC commands can be found at : OSC command\nUI UX: On the start up of the laser slides application we could see an on-boading page with a quick introduction of the application. In the home page we could see 3 navigation buttons, “Home” directing to the buttons page, “About”button directing to the instructions page and “settings” page which will lead to opening of a bottom sheet to configure the settings of the application. The home page has buttons to manipulate the slides, the buttons are designed to showcase a 3d button press animation. On double tapping on any button it leads to opening of a popup with HERO animation enabling the user to edit the button.\nNote - The Application does not have any user on boarding process such as registration."

Traditionally, controlling such a complex system has often relied on conventional input methods. However, the LG Gesture & Voice Control project challenges this norm by introducing innovative and intuitive modes of interaction.\nCreated using Flutter, its capabilities enable the creation of a seamless and visually appealing interface that serves as the foundation for gesture and voice control functionalities. This cross-platform nature ensures that the benefits of this project can be enjoyed across multiple devices and operating systems.\nMediapipe, a robust open-source framework developed by Google, plays a pivotal role in this project. It provides a rich set of tools for building applications that involve perception-based tasks, including gesture and pose recognition. By integrating Mediapipe's capabilities, the LG Gesture & Voice Control project can accurately track hand gestures and body poses, translating them into actionable commands for the Liquid Galaxy Rig. This allows users to manipulate and navigate the system using natural movements.\nThe project bridges the gap between humans and machines by seamlessly blending gesture recognition, voice commands, and intuitive user interfaces. Users can easily navigate the Liquid Galaxy Rig, simplifying complex tasks and amplifying the system's accessibility.\nThe potential applications of the LG Gesture & Voice Control project are diverse. From educational presentations and interactive exhibitions to artistic displays and immersive entertainment experiences, the project opens doors to new modes of engagement.\nLG Gesture & Voice Control underscores the dynamic nature of human-computer interaction. The fusion of Flutter, Mediapipe, ML Kit, and voice recognition technology showcases modern development tools' capabilities and paves the way for future advancements in user experience design."

By simply installing the games and the LGRG server on your Liquid Galaxy master you can quickly launch and stop games on all screens and also get access to a specific controller for the chosen game and a QR code for other players to easily access the controller as well! More information about the installation of the games and the LGRG server can be found in the github repository which can be found by clicking the info icon on the top right of the app and then the github button on the app bar.\n\nThis project was developed for the Google Summer of Code 2021 by brazilian student Leonardo Coelho Ruas in collaboration with the Liquid Galaxy Project Organization.\n\n"

Additionally, the application is autonomous, and without being connected to the LG, it is able to represent and display information on the mobile device itself. The project consists of three parts:\n\nThe first part represents past forest fires, allows the user to see all the affected areas, the development of the forest fire, and all the information represented on the Liquid Galaxy.\n\nThe second part helps visualize real-time fires, whether they are forest fires or house fires, on the Liquid Galaxy and see their information.\n\nIn the third part of the project, what is dealt with is to represent the risks of forest fires in the United States area.\n\nThe Liquid Galaxy is a cluster of screens with Google Earth that synchronize witheach other to create the sensation of a single screen, depending on the configuration it can be panoramic, vertical, curved, etc. Through this tool, we are able to represent fires and see the impacts in an interactive and easy-to-see detail. Additionally, we are able to find a lot of important data about the fire, such as the extent, emitted gases, possible victims, key points, extinguishing techniques, possible improvements, front speed, fire score, type of smoke column, smoke data, etc."

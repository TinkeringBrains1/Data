The laser slides application can be best viewed in Tablet devices with a minimum screen size of 8” inches.\nInstructions:\n-- Firstly, in order to use the laser slides application the system should have BEYOND software installed in the system.\n-- On the BEYOND application we must go to the “setting” -> “OSC” -> “OSC settings” and then look up for the IP address such as “192.168.29.219”.\n-- Once we know the IP address, start the laser slides application on a tablet device. We should configure the settings to control the slides in BEYOND software.\n-- Now go to settings in the application enter the IP address and PORT as “8000”, After entering the values in the fields click on the “Save” button, if you see a popup with message “Connection Successful” you are good to go!!.\n-- Now that we have made a successful connection with BEYOND, Go to the “Home” section in the app. Here you can control the slides with various buttons and customize with your desired functionality as well.\n-- The Slides are generally manipulated using OSC commands, which you can assign to each button on “double tapping” on any button.\n-- You can see a popup on your screen by double tapping on any button. The popup has various fields, Here enter the desired button name, and the OSC command such as “0 1” or “0 3” etc. once entered click on save button and the settings will be saved.\n-- The initial digit in the OSC command represents the row number and the second number represents the cell number in that row.\nAll the OSC commands can be found at : OSC command\nUI UX: On the start up of the laser slides application we could see an on-boading page with a quick introduction of the application. In the home page we could see 3 navigation buttons, “Home” directing to the buttons page, “About”button directing to the instructions page and “settings” page which will lead to opening of a bottom sheet to configure the settings of the application. The home page has buttons to manipulate the slides, the buttons are designed to showcase a 3d button press animation. On double tapping on any button it leads to opening of a popup with HERO animation enabling the user to edit the button.\nNote - The Application does not have any user on boarding process such as registration."

From there, the entire application would be controlled through a script responsible for managing calls made to the satellite's external APIs (e.g. NASA API and Copernicus) that responses with the metadata necessary for the kml creation and a tablet application that would give the user control of which layers or information would like to be displayed and responsible for handling the API calls, manipulate KMLs and sending them to Liquid Galaxy through Bash scripts.

Traditionally, controlling such a complex system has often relied on conventional input methods. However, the LG Gesture & Voice Control project challenges this norm by introducing innovative and intuitive modes of interaction.\nCreated using Flutter, its capabilities enable the creation of a seamless and visually appealing interface that serves as the foundation for gesture and voice control functionalities. This cross-platform nature ensures that the benefits of this project can be enjoyed across multiple devices and operating systems.\nMediapipe, a robust open-source framework developed by Google, plays a pivotal role in this project. It provides a rich set of tools for building applications that involve perception-based tasks, including gesture and pose recognition. By integrating Mediapipe's capabilities, the LG Gesture & Voice Control project can accurately track hand gestures and body poses, translating them into actionable commands for the Liquid Galaxy Rig. This allows users to manipulate and navigate the system using natural movements.\nThe project bridges the gap between humans and machines by seamlessly blending gesture recognition, voice commands, and intuitive user interfaces. Users can easily navigate the Liquid Galaxy Rig, simplifying complex tasks and amplifying the system's accessibility.\nThe potential applications of the LG Gesture & Voice Control project are diverse. From educational presentations and interactive exhibitions to artistic displays and immersive entertainment experiences, the project opens doors to new modes of engagement.\nLG Gesture & Voice Control underscores the dynamic nature of human-computer interaction. The fusion of Flutter, Mediapipe, ML Kit, and voice recognition technology showcases modern development tools' capabilities and paves the way for future advancements in user experience design."
